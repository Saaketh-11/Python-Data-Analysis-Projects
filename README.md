Telecom Churn Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing customer churn data from a telecom company. The analysis involves exploring the dataset, visualizing trends, and deriving insights to understand customer behavior and churn patterns.

Project Overview
The project uses the following steps to analyze the dataset:

Data Loading and Exploration: Loading the dataset and examining its structure.
Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling missing or erroneous values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing key trends and correlations using matplotlib and seaborn.
Feature Engineering: Preparing the data for machine learning models.
Modeling and Evaluation: Applying machine learning algorithms to predict churn and evaluating their performance.
Key Outcomes
Data Overview
The dataset contains 7043 records with 21 columns, including features like customer demographics, service details, and churn status.
Key columns include:
customerID: Unique ID for each customer.
tenure: Number of months the customer has been with the company.
MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges: Billing details.
Churn: Target variable indicating if the customer churned.
Initial Insights
The dataset has no missing values in most columns, but TotalCharges needs to be converted from object to numerical type.
Distribution analysis shows trends in customer behavior based on their tenure, contract type, and services used.
Visualizations
Churn rates are higher among customers with month-to-month contracts.
Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.
Technologies Used
Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
